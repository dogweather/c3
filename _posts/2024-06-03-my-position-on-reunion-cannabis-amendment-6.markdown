**I'm in favor of the amendment** allowing cannabis sales at E. 104th & Tower Rd.

**But I'm skeptical that Social Cannabis can
deliver** the promised "premium" build-out. (_Source:_ Applicant Presentation.) Or,
decorated "to the nines", as Josh promised me.


## Comparing Others to Social Cannabis:

### Well Designed Denver-Area Dispensaries

These signal "premium" and up-market:
artistic, playful, a relaxed & un-hurried atmosphere,
space left unused, lack of clutter, subtle messaging, orginality.
Finally, they all use colors, materials, typography, textures, and lighting
to create consistency.

      <img src="{{ image.path }}" alt="{{ image.title }}"/>
    </a>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

### Social Cannabis Dispensaries

S.C. creates ultra-low-budget, down-market build-outs. Plastic Walmart furniture, no flooring, no art,
non-matching colors, interiors cluttered with manufacturer marketing materials, 
papered over windows, messy counters and displays used for storage.

**I couldn't find any decoration or art** with the exception of the billboard-sized "Mile High in Colorado" 
sign in Golden. (The last image, above.) However, its uniqueness plus the large print and placement in front of massive windows gives me 
the impression of it being an end-run around Golden's signage regulations: It's advertisement, visible 
from hundreds of feet away. Also note that the message, "Mile High…" lacks the upscale subtlety of the 
other dispensaries.

**I'm in touch with S.C. people** and attended their presentation. 
I was very supportive of them until I saw their current stores.
Now, of course, my enthusiasm has cooled off.
if they responsd, I'll post it here if they'd like. 
I'm doing my best not to blindside them:
Before making my critique public, I let them
know about my position on the issue.

**What I'd really like** is for Social Cannabis to follow through; 
to show us how they'll meet the expectations they set. I believe all it'd take
is hiring an interior designer / architect who has experience producing great
environments.

Here's **<a href="/assets/letter.pdf">my original letter</a>** to the City Council.
