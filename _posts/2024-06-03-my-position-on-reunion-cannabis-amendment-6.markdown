**I'm in favor of the amendment** allowing cannabis sales at E. 104th & Tower Rd.

**But I'm skeptical that Social Cannabis can
deliver** the promised "premium" build-out. (_Source:_ Applicant Presentation.)


## Compare Others to Social Cannabis:

### Well Designed Denver-Area Dispensaries

These signal "premium" and up-market:
artistic, playful, a relaxed & un-hurried atmosphere,
space left unused, lack of clutter, subtle messaging, orginality.
Finally, they all use colors, materials, typography, textures, and lighting
to create consistency.

<div class="gallery" style="margin-bottom: 2em">
  {% for image in page.images.other %}
    <a href="{{ image.path }}" title="{{ image.title }}">
      <img src="{{ image.path }}" alt="{{ image.title }}"/>
    </a>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

### Social Cannabis Dispensaries

S.C. creates ultra-low-budget, down-market build-outs. Plastic Walmart furniture, no flooring, no art,
non-matching colors, interiors cluttered with manufacturer marketing materials, 
papered over windows, messy counters and displays used for storage.


<div class="gallery" style="margin-bottom: 2em">
  {% for image in page.images.social_cannabis %}
    <a href="{{ image.path }}" title="{{ image.title }}">
      <img src="{{ image.path }}" alt="{{ image.title }}"/>
    </a>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

The only original decoration or art I could find in any of their locations is the billboard-sized "Mile High in Colorado" 
sign in Golden. (The last image, above.) However, its uniqueness plus the large print and placement in front of massive windows gives me 
the impression of it being an end-run around Golden's signage regulations: It's advertisement, visible 
from hundreds of feet away. Also note that the message, "Mile Highâ€¦" lacks the upscale subtlety of the 
other dispensaries.

I'd like for Social Cannabis to show us how they'll meet the expectations they set.
