Street light outages **are handled by the two power companies** in town, not
the city.
[North of E.96th Ave it's United Power. South of E. 96th it's Xcel Energy.](https://www.c3gov.com/living-in/utilities) That page gives the contact info for each company. But I was able to get a street light fixed by reporting it to the city.

mobile app.

I submitted a report, the city handed it off, and it got fixed in a week. Here
are before and after pics plus screenshots from the app:
