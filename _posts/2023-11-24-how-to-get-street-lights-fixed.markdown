Street light outages **are handled by the two power companies** in town, not
the city.
[North of E.96th Ave it's United Power. South of E. 96th it's Xcel Energy.](https://www.c3gov.com/living-in/utilities)


# When we can water

Irrigation watering is allowed three days a week, from evening until morning: between **6pm** and **10am**.

The actual days we can use the irrigation water depends on whether our
street address is even or odd.

| Address | Irrigation Days              |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Even:   | Sunday, Wednesday & Friday   |
| Odd:    | Tuesday, Thursday & Saturday |
