# Context:

Commerce City gets its water from Adams County. We have a (pretty cool
in my opinion) dual water supply system: drinking water *and* irrigation
water. To balance out demand, Adams County created a "mandatory watering
schedule".


## The Rule

Irrigation watering is allowed three days a week, from evening until morning: between **6pm** and **10am**.

The actual days we can use the irrigation water depends on whether our
street address is even or odd.

| Address | Irrigation Days              |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Even:   | Sunday, Wednesday & Friday   |
| Odd:    | Tuesday, Thursday & Saturday |
