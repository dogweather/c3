Commerce City gets its water from Adams County. North of E. 96th Ave, [the
county constructed a dual water supply system](https://www.southadamswaterco.gov/water___wastewater/irrigation_information.php): **drinking water** and
**irrigation water**. Pretty cool, in my opinion. I'd never seen anything
like this before moving here. Anyhow, to balance out demand, Adams County created a "mandatory watering
schedule".


# When we can water

Irrigation watering is allowed three days a week, from evening until morning: between **6pm** and **10am**.

The actual days we can use the irrigation water depends on whether our
street address is even or odd.

| Address | Irrigation Days              |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Even:   | Sunday, Wednesday & Friday   |
| Odd:    | Tuesday, Thursday & Saturday |
