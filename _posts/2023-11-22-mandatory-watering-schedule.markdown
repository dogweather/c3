In Adams County, we have a "mandatory watering schedule":


> Three days a week, between **6pm** and **10am**.

The actual days we can use the irrigation water depends on whether our
street address is even or odd:

| Address | Irrigation Days                  |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| Even:   | **Sunday, Wednesday & Friday**   |
| Odd:    | **Tuesday, Thursday & Saturday** |
